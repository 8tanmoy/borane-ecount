    "\n",
    "Electron counting rules lead to a systematic expansion of knowledge concerning a set of\n",
    "molecules of interest, by permitting the incorporation of experimental and theoretical\n",
    "findings within a logically consistent and reasonably simple framework1. It helps in\n",
    "reducing the complexity of large number of experimental observations and presenting\n",
    "an abstract generalisation. There exist many electron counting rules in chemistry such\n",
    "as – Lewis Octet Rule, Huckel’s 4n+2 rule, Wade’s n+1 Rule etc.\n",

    "## mno Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "mno rule is a generally applicable electron‐counting that integrates macropolyhedral\n",
    "boranes, metallaboranes, and metallocenes and any combination of them. According to\n",
    "this rule, m + n + o number of electron pairs are necessary for a macropolyhedral system\n",
    "to be stable. Here, m is the number of polyhedra, n is the number of vertices, and o is the\n",
    "number of single‐vertex‐sharing condensations. For nido and arachno arrangements,\n",
    "one and two additional pairs of electrons are required.\n",
