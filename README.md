## Introduction  

Electron counting rules lead to a systematic expansion of knowledge concerning a set of
molecules of interest, by permitting the incorporation of experimental and theoretical
findings within a logically consistent and reasonably simple framework1. It helps in
reducing the complexity of large number of experimental observations and presenting
an abstract generalisation. There exist many electron counting rules in chemistry such
as – Lewis Octet Rule, Huckel’s 4n+2 rule, Wade’s n+1 Rule etc.

## mno Rule

mno rule is a generally applicable electron‐counting that integrates macropolyhedral
boranes, metallaboranes, and metallocenes and any combination of them. According to
this rule, m + n + o number of electron pairs are necessary for a macropolyhedral system
to be stable. Here, m is the number of polyhedra, n is the number of vertices, and o is the
number of single‐vertex‐sharing condensations. For nido and arachno arrangements,
one and two additional pairs of electrons are required.

## Aim

The intention of this project is to unify the previously suggested generating formulae of
condensed macropolyhedral boranes into a single equation using the variables ‐-  
m = number of polyhedra condensed  
s = number of vertices in a polyhedron  
t = type of condensation: number of points shared, such as:  
t = 1 for single vertex sharing  
t = 2 for edge sharing  
t = 3 for face sharing  
t = 4 for 4‐vertex sharing, and  
o = number of single atom sharing = m ‐1 when t =1  
and = 0 when t > 1
