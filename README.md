## Introduction  

Electron counting rules lead to a systematic expansion of knowledge concerning a set of
molecules of interest, by permitting the incorporation of experimental and theoretical
findings within a logically consistent and reasonably simple framework1. It helps in
reducing the complexity of large number of experimental observations and presenting
an abstract generalisation. There exist many electron counting rules in chemistry such
as – Lewis Octet Rule, Huckel’s 4n+2 rule, Wade’s n+1 Rule etc.
